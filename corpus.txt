The state is experiencing a potential display of northern lights due to a strong geomagnetic storm, forecast. According to experts, the NOAA has issued a G3 storm warning, which indicates that residents in the northern parts of Indiana might witness the aurora if conditions align.
The recent solar flare, the biggest since 2017, could make the northern lights visible, especially in the northern horizon of the state. However, seeing them is not guaranteed; 
viewers will need to venture away from city lights and might even require a camera with a long exposure setting to capture the phenomenon. 
Observers in neighboring states like Michigan and Wisconsin are expected to have better visibility. Additionally, the moon will set early, helping create optimal dark skies for the event, though weather conditions could still impact visibility.
